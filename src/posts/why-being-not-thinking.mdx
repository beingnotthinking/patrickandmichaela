## Being Not Thinking. Be Here Now. Mindfulness. Present.

All of these live on the same wavelength. The idea that you should be completely present in what you are doing. We spend all day doing things, but often our minds wander. They are thinking about yesterday, all that needs to be done today, future plans that you are looking forward to, everything but the actual thing that you are currently in the process of doing! It is exhausting! But it does not have to be that way.

This idea came into my life about 4 years ago at the age of 23. At the time I was in a pretty bad headspace. I was dealing with depression, the realization that the tech startup job I landed after years of working helpdesk didn't actually make me happy, and coming to terms with the fact that the societies status quo says "It is fine to be miserable, suck it up, make good money, and in 40 years you can relax and enjoy life".
That all changed after I had my first psychedelic experience. For legalities sake, let's just say it was achieved through meditation.

What a step back from life that gave me. An absolute change in perspective. Through continued use, I went from a cynical, depressed, miserable person into, well, a bit of a mess in a way. There is a common saying about the psychedelic experience "It will give you what you need, not what you want". Boy I felt that. I realized I had a lot of undealt with trauma and was not loving the world, nor myself, nearly enough. Through the support of my lovely wife Michaela and a couple different therapists along the way, all of that changed. I can now confidently say I do love myself. I have immense empathy towards the world and the people who live here. And although I of course am still finding things to work through, I have made incredible strides to becoming a healthy person, who is, dare I say it, happy.

But what does that happiness look like? What does it feel like? Well, that's just it. It's being present. It's being mindful. It's being here, right now. And it is being and not thinking. This translates directly into my happiness. It drives me towards living now, chasing dreams, loving myself, loving others, loving the world.

I hope through this BeingNotThinking project I am able to share my experience and help meet others, whether they are folks who live on a similar wavelength or folks who need some help getting here. Whatever it be, I would love to chat.

## Wait, so where did being not thinking actually come from?

The direct quote of "be, not think" stuck in my head while watching Fargo season 2. Peggy is having arguably her own psychedelic experience and asks how she can "Actualize", becoming the woman she dreams of being. The advice given is to be that person. Be the person you dream of being. If that person wakes up and meditates, then when you wake up, meditate. I know I have often fell into that trap of "thinking" of all of the things I want to do. I spent years thinking of moving to the pacific north west. Years thinking about traveling the country. It was time to stop thinking about those things and time to start being the me that was doing them.
