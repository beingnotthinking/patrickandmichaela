## Where we started

Michaela and I spent nearly all of our lives in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago. As we started going to community college and getting basic jobs, we gradually made our way closer and closer to Chicago. Our last apartment was in a Chicago neighborhood where I was a 20 minute EL Train commute to my work and a 35 minute commute to Michaela's school. We spent two years in Chicago and although the first few months were great, seeing live music and being close to friends, we unfortunately spent most of our time in Chicago in covid times.

## Why Washington?

I made a very good friend while working at a startup in Chicago but after just a few months he accepted a job he could not refuse out in Seattle. It was very sad at the time but was enough to get me on an airplane for the first time. I absolutely loved the amount of nature you could experience in just one area. After a few more visits including Michaela, we knew that the Pacific North West was a place we wanted to be.

## Where are we now

We are currently living in our van full time. We spent the Summer and most of the fall in the PNW and then went back to Chicago to visit some friends and family for the holidays while also putting a lot of finishing touches on the Van. At the time of this post we are in the Southwest, spending the winter as snow birds trying to keep warm. After that we plan to see California, more of the PNW and hopefully make our way to Alaska for the Summer. The fun part about Vanlife is that you can set plans and they will change on the drop of a dime. It is a very flexible way to live that we really enjoy, but it can for sure be hard to make long term plans.
