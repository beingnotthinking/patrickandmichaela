I believe each person has a very personal reason they are choosing to meditate. 

Often it can be pretty high level such as "being present" but I have found the more I meditate, the more meaningful my time and clearer my intentions become. My favorite part about this clarity is how I can integrate it into my every day life. 

Here are two tips I have picked up and really enjoyed to bring into my life. 

### Yellow Stickers
This tip was picked up from David Nichtern's Meditation for Everyday Life course. 
There is an idea in meditation around a gap which is specifically the space between your thoughts. Our minds are constantly filled with thoughts. Thoughts about the past. Thoughts about the future. Thoughts about really anything that isn't what you are doing right now. But every once in a while there is a split where your mind is just quiet. That is the gap.

I never really appreciated the gap until it was brought to my attention but once aware of it I really wished I could get it more. David suggested putting small yellow post it dots in places you often look, without maybe thinking about it too hard. When you see the dots later, it helps provide that gap. I love the fact that it pulls me out of what I am doing and gives me a breath, a gap, a moment, to be right where I am. 

### Vertical Transitions 
This tip came from headspace: when you get up or get down (ha), take a moment to take a breath. This means when you go from sitting to standing, or standing to laying down, just take a beat. Give yourself that gap to be present. The first day I tried I thought about it maybe twice in the whole day, but as I have the intention and want to bring the things I learn from meditation into my every day life, it becomes more ingrained that when you transition you take a moment to be. 

Meditation has added so much to my life over the years, and even more so since I started practicing seriously in the last year. I hope to pick up and share more tips, but for now I hope you can take these and bring them into your life in a meaningful way.
