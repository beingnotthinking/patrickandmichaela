I want to take a moment to talk about what I am doing to build the foundations of my meditation practice.

For the past few years I have picked up meditation and have not stuck with it. I think a lot of people fall into a similar trap. They know something would be good for them, whether it is meditation, eating healthy, or going to the gym, but it is hard in everyday life to stick through things, especially in a world that promotes stress, anxiety, and running yourself thin. 

After some recent transformative therapy, I was able to pick a few new habits that have really improved my life and one of those is meditation.

### What I have been doing

#### Meditation for Everyday Life by David Nichtern
I bought this creative live course a few years ago after watching episode 6 of Midnight Gospel. I really loved what David had to say and wanted to learn more. The course is given in an interesting in person and online classroom setting. It is probably a bit faster paced than more traditional courses, but gives a great run down of mindfulness meditation as a base and further information for those who are curious. 

#### Headspace
One of my main goals of meditation was to provide myself some space from the fast paced notification filled world so it seems kind of counter productive to use an App for daily meditation. I had a good friend recommend Headspace and honestly it has been great. Going through the meditation basics and seeing how it lined up with what David was teaching helped ensure me that I was on a path I'd like to be on.  


### How it has helped my everyday life

#### Mentally
I think the most noticable benefit so far has been the space to not react to things and instead take the time and thought to respond. 

#### Physically
This is somewhat of a secondary benefit, but sitting with myself for 15-20 minutes a day has helped me realize what hurts and that I should be doing something to fix it. 

The "What hurts" varies from day to day, but I have taken to typing "Adriene ____ pain" into youtube and going through a video whenever I have noticable pain and it has been life changing. 

### Advice for building habits
It is cliche but the best advice I have to give is just start. They say it takes around 23 days to build a habit, so just set a couple reminders during the day to meditate. You won't make every one as your life will probably get a little in the way, but if you have one set for the morning, afternoon, and night you will at least have the reminder to take the time to meet your goals.
