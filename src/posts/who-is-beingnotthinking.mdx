# Hello! Thank you for checking out our blog! And thank you for taking a little bit of time to get to know us better.

## Together

Together we are Patrick and Michaela. We met in a small town and like a lot of teenagers, fell in love. Unlike a large percentage of those teenagers, we have built an impulsive teenage marriage into a nearly 10 year relationship, 7 of which have been while married. Over these 10 years we have grown into people who arguably couldn't be further from the people we started as, but that is a story for a different day.

Howdy! It is always hard to give an introduction about yourself. Who exactly are you? Are you your name? Your career? Your past? Hard to say! Alan Watts describes a person as the patterns they often portray, so let's start there.

The pattern I enjoy most is getting to know people. I love hearing about the different experiences and perspectives individuals have gained during their time on this Earth. In my experience, there is no more perfect a night than one spent having deep conversations with new or old friends.

I am currently on a journey to meet more people, make deeper connections, and experience life to the fullest. Living in a van is a means to that end.

You can expect posts from me about traveling, meditation, mental health, and living in small spaces!

I am a pretty open book and happy to share about my experiences, so if you ever feel the inkling to reach out, please do, I would love to talk!

I would say most of my life I’ve been in survival mode and this is the first time I’ve really gotten to thrive. I’m still healing, as I probably always will be, but I’m finally moving forward. For the first time I’m letting myself enjoy life and be happy. I’d love to help others get to a point of accepting themselves and enjoying their lives. I know how difficult it can be to get to that point. Today, I am proud of myself for how far I have come with my education, working through my anxiety, and learning to love myself.

On a happy note; here’s some things that bring me joy: art, writing, reading, green witchcraft, roller skating (although I’m not any good at it), and creating content.

I look forward to sharing my journey, connecting with others, and hopefully helping others heal.
